        Hi! I am Samyuktha Ganeshkumar.
        <br /> <br />
        My professional life so far has been pretty exciting by dabbling in
        different internships and projects. My core skills are in Web
        Development but I am aspiring to become a Product Manager someday and
        create tech products from scratch that creates impact in the world we
        live in.
        <br /> <br />I live in a beautiful foothill town called Theni in
        Tamilnadu but as someone just starting her next decade of life, I love
        exploring new places and with the pandemic finally coming to an end, I
        want to travel to every country in the world! I am mostly watching new
        movies whenever I get time.
